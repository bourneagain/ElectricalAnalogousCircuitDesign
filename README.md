### About
The project acquaints the user with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help him bridge the gap between the conversions of Mechanical System designed virtually using this software to equivalent electrical analogous circuit for easier and better study of the mechanical design.  

Once obtained, the electrical analogy paves way for accurate and easier manipulation and further research into the development of designed mechanical design.
