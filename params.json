So as a student of core electrical branch, I decided to use electrical analogy for mechanical designs for easier and better model analysis. This project's objective is to obtain equivalent electrical analogous circuit for the user designed mechanical systems aiming to be of aid to the mechanical engineers. The electrical analogous systems once obtained are far easier to work with than old mechanical designs. This project is written in popular C programming language keeping in mind user friendliness.\r\n\r\n￼￼￼￼LANGUAGE USED: COMPILER USED : PLATFORM USED:\r\nC Programming Language\r\nTurbo C++ Compiler, Version 3.0 MS DOS\r\n\r\nABOUT THE PROJECT:\r\nThe project acquaints the user with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help him bridge the gap between the conversions of Mechanical System designed virtually using this software to equivalent electrical analogous circuit for easier and better study of the mechanical design. Once obtained, the electrical analogy paves way for accurate and easier manipulation and further research into the development of designed mechanical design.\r\n￼￼\r\n￼￼INTRODUCTION:\r\nThe program welcomes the user with a brief introduction about the software. The Home Screen acts like the home page of a website containing links to the two broad divisions of this package namely the Mechanical Translation and Mechanical Rotational Systems. When user moves the mouse pointer over the screen, help is provided to the user for better navigation through contextual help display at the bottom of the screen. The entire screen is designed to give the user a feel of déjà vu as it mimics the windows classic style. The usage of mouse programming for navigation is an example.\r\nThe same screen characteristics are carried forward to subsequent screens too. In the Mechanical Translation screen the user views the screen divided into four sections, The Tools Palette, The Design Area, The Title Bar, The Menu Bar, and Help Bar.\r\nIn the Tools Palette, buttons for placing mechanical design elements have been provided, namely Mass M, Spring K, Dash Pot B, Force F, B-Dir.\r\nThe Design Area is the workplace where the designer can design the mechanical systems virtually using the concept of pick-n-place of the design elements from the tools palette.\r\nIn the Menu Bar the user can choose the option of getting either Force-Voltage Equivalent Electrical Analogous Circuit or Force-Current Equivalent Electrical Analogous Circuit. The user is aided further by the display of Contextual Help at the bottom in help bar.\r\nIn the Help Bar, the user is given onscreen contextual help as and when the user moves the cursor over the items on the screen. The user friendliness of the software is given prime importance right from the design stage itself.\r\n￼￼Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C\r\n-1-\r\n￼￼\r\n￼￼CONCEPTS USED:\r\n￼Graphical User Interface (GUI)\r\nThe selection of various software elements and other options can be done using virtual buttons designed and placed on the user screen. When the user clicks on the button, the function of the button is displayed in the help bar. This gives the user as to what and how the button’s function is to be used. The various graphics functions in C like rectangle(), circle() and so on as well as the user defined graphical functions are used logically for the construction of the user screen as well as being the backbone of circuit design aid. The GUI is an attractive feature in this project.\r\nMouse Programming\r\nGUI and mouse go hand in hand. The mouse is used in the select screen to select the choices and to press the button. Also the user can position the design elements by using mouse. Mouse programming is done using int86() function of C programming language. The interrupt used in this program is INT 33H.\r\nStructure Concept\r\nAs the entire concept of the project is logical graphic design, the coordinates of the design elements placed on the screen by the user are the only means of deriving any logics for further processing. In order to efficiently store and process coordinates of design elements, the coordinates are stored as separate structures. This paves way for easy manipulation and for the evolution into the desired electrical analogous circuit.\r\nForce-Voltage and Force-Current Analysis\r\nThis analysis is used for obtaining electrical equivalent analogous circuits. The analysis is based on mapping between mechanical elements and electrical parameters such as resistance, inductance, capacitance as well as voltage and current sources.\r\n￼￼Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C\r\n-2-\r\n￼￼\r\n￼￼IDEA:\r\nA System remains analogous as long as the differential equations governing the system or transfer functions are of identical form. The electrical analogue of any other kind of system is of great importance since it is easier to construct electrical models and analyze them.\r\nThe three basic elements Mass, Dashpot and Spring that are used in modeling Mechanical Translational systems are analogous to Resistance, Inductance and Capacitance of electrical systems. The input force in mechanical system is analogous to either voltage source or current source in electrical systems. The output velocity in mechanical system is analogous to either current or voltage in an element in electrical system. Since the electrical system has two types of inputs either voltage or current source, there are two types of analogies namely Force-Voltage Analogy and Force-Current Analogy.\r\nOur idea is to derive the electrical equivalent for the user designed mechanical model. The basic logic behind the conversion follows the mapping of the mechanical realizable models to the equivalent Electrical Model.\r\n￼￼Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C\r\n-3-\r\n￼￼\r\n￼￼Representation of SUSPENSION SYSTEM using PHYSICAL MODEL\r\n￼ANALOGOUS SYSTEMS\r\nForce – Voltage Analogous Circuit Force - Current Analogous Circuit\r\n￼￼￼￼￼Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C\r\n-4-\r\n￼￼\r\n￼￼￼￼Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C\r\n￼￼MECHANICAL TRANSLATIONAL & ROTATIONAL SYSTEMS:\r\nIt is possible to make electrical and mechanical systems using analogs. An analogous\r\nelectrical and mechanical system will have differential equations of the same form.\r\nMECHANICAL TRANSLATIONAL SYSTEMS:\r\nThe model of Mechanical Translational Systems can be obtained by using three basic elements Mass, Spring and Dashpot. The weight of the mechanical system is represented by the Element Mass and it is assumed to be concentrated at the center of the body. The elastic deformation of the body can be represented by a spring. The friction existing in a mechanical system can be represented by a dashpot.\r\nMECHANICAL ROTATIONAL SYSTEMS:\r\nThe model of Mechanical Rotational Systems can be obtained by using three basic elements moment of inertia of Mass, Dashpot with rotational frictional coefficient and Torsion Spring with stiffness. The weight of the mechanical system is represented by the Moment Of Inertia of the mass and it is assumed to be concentrated at the center of the body. The elastic deformation of the body can be represented by a Torsion Spring. The friction existing in a mechanical system can be represented by a dashpot\r\nELECTRICAL ANALOGOUS OF MECHANICAL TRANSLATIONAL SYSTEMS:\r\nSome points to be kept in mind while deriving electrical analogies,\r\nSystem remains analogous as long as the differential equations governing the system or transfer functions are of identical form.\r\nThe electrical analogue of any other kind of system is of great importance since it is easier to construct electrical models and analyze them.\r\nThe input force in mechanical system is analogous to either voltage source or current source in electrical systems.
