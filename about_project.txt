 ELECTRICAL ANALOGOUS CIRCUIT DESIGN USING C 
 
PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
“The true creator is necessity, which is the mother of invention” 
 -Plato
 
Heretofore the mechanical designs were analyzed using cryptic mechanical models. 
So as a student of core electrical branch, I decided to use electrical analogy for mechanical 
designs for easier and better model analysis. This project's objective is to obtain equivalent 
electrical analogous circuit for the user designed mechanical systems aiming to be of aid to
the mechanical engineers. The electrical analogous systems once obtained are far easier to 
work with than old mechanical designs. This project is written in popular C programming 
language keeping in mind user friendliness.

LANGUAGE USED: C Programming Language
COMPILER USED : Turbo C++ Compiler, Version 3.0
PLATFORM USED: MS DOS

ABOUT THE PROJECT:
The project acquaints the user with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help him
bridge the gap between the conversions of Mechanical System designed virtually using this 
software to equivalent electrical analogous circuit for easier and better study of the 
mechanical design. Once obtained, the electrical analogy paves way for accurate and ea sier 
manipulation and further research into the development of designed mechanical design.Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C

INTRODUCTION:
The program welcomes the user with a brief introduction about the software. The 
Home Screen acts like the home page of a website containing links to the two broad 
divisions of this package namely the Mechanical Translation and Mechanical Rotational 
Systems. When user moves the mouse pointer over the screen, help is provided to the user 
for better navigation through contextual help display at the bottom of the screen. The entire 
screen is designed to give the user a feel of déjà vu as it mimics the windows classic style. 
The usage of mouse programming for navigation is an example.
The same screen characteristics are carried forward to subsequent screens too. In the 
Mechanical Translation screen the user views the screen divided into four sections, The 
Tools Palette, The Design Area, The Title Bar, The Menu Bar, and Help Bar.
In the Tools Palette, buttons for placing mechanical design elements have been 
provided, namely Mass M, Spring K, Dash Pot B, Force F, B-Dir.
The Design Area is the workplace where the designer can design the mechanical 
systems virtually using the concept of pick-n-place of the design elements from the tools 
palette. 
In the Menu Bar the user can choose the option of getting either Force-Voltage 
Equivalent Electrical Analogous Circuit or Force-Current Equivalent Electrical Analogous 
Circuit. The user is aided further by the display of Contextual Help at the bottom in help 
bar.
In the Help Bar, the user is given onscreen contextual help as and when the user 
moves the cursor over the items on the screen. The user friendliness of the software is given 
prime importance right from the design stage itself.Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C

CONCEPTS USED:
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The selection of various software elements and other options can be done using
virtual buttons designed and placed on the user screen. When the user clicks on the button, 
the function of the button is displayed in the help bar. This gives the user as to what and 
how the button’s function is to be used. The various graphics functions in C like rectangle(), 
circle() and so on as well as the user defined graphical functions are used logically for the 
construction of the user screen as well as being the backbone of circuit design aid. The GUI 
is an attractive feature in this project.
Mouse Programming

GUI and mouse go hand in hand. The mouse is used in the select screen to select the 
choices and to press the button. Also the user can position the design elements by using 
mouse. Mouse programming is done using int86() function of C programming language. 
The interrupt used in this program is INT 33H.
Structure Concept

As the entire concept of the project is logical graphic design, the coordinates of the 
design elements placed on the screen by the user are the only means of deriving any logics 
for further processing. In order to efficiently store and process coordinates of design 
elements, the coordinates are stored as separate structures. This paves way for easy 
manipulation and for the evolution into the desired electrical analogous circuit.
Force-Voltage and Force-Current Analysis
This analysis is used for obtaining electrical equivalent analogous circuits. The 
analysis is based on mapping between mechanical elements and electrical parameters such 
as resistance, inductance, capacitance as well as voltage and current sources.Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C

IDEA:
A System remains analogous as long as the differential equations governing the 
system or transfer functions are of identical form. The electrical analogue of any other kind 
of system is of great importance since it is easier to construct electrical models and analyze 
them.
The three basic elements Mass, Dashpot and Spring that are used in modeling 
Mechanical Translational systems are analogous to Resistance, Inductance and Capacitance
of electrical systems. The input force in mechanical system is analogous to either voltage 
source or current source in electrical systems. The output velocity in mechanical system is 
analogous to either current or voltage in an element in electrical system. Since the electrical 
system has two types of inputs either voltage or current source, there are two types of 
analogies namely Force-Voltage Analogy and Force-Current Analogy.
Our idea is to derive the electrical equivalent for the user designed mechanical 
model. The basic logic behind the conversion follows the mapping of the mechanical 
realizable models to the equivalent Electrical Model. Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C


MECHANICAL TRANSLATIONAL & ROTATIONAL SYSTEMS:
It is possible to make electrical and mechanical systems using analogs. An analogous 
electrical and mechanical system will have differential equations of the same form.
MECHANICAL TRANSLATIONAL SYSTEMS:
The model of Mechanical Translational Systems can be obtained by using three basic 
elements Mass, Spring and Dashpot. The weight of the mechanical system is represented by the 
Element Mass and it is assumed to be concentrated at the center of the body. The elastic 
deformation of the body can be represented by a spring. The friction existing in a mechanical 
system can be represented by a dashpot.
MECHANICAL ROTATIONAL SYSTEMS:
The model of Mechanical Rotational Systems can be obtained by using three basic 
elements moment of inertia of Mass, Dashpot with rotational frictional coefficient and Torsion
Spring with stiffness. The weight of the mechanical system is represented by the Moment Of 
Inertia of the mass and it is assumed to be concentrated at the center of the body. The elastic 
deformation of the body can be represented by a Torsion Spring. The friction existing in a 
mechanical system can be represented by a dashpot

ELECTRICAL ANALOGOUS OF MECHANICAL TRANSLATIONAL 
SYSTEMS:

Some points to be kept in mind while deriving electrical analogies,
System remains analogous as long as the differential equations governing the system or 
transfer functions are of identical form. 
The electrical analogue of any other kind of system is of great importance since it is 
easier to construct electrical models and analyze them.
The input force in mechanical system is analogous to either voltage source or current 
source in electrical systems. The output velocity in mechanical system is analogous to 
either current or voltage in an element in electrical system. Electrical Analogous Circuit Design Using C

GUIDELINES TO OBTAIN ELECTRICAL ANALOGOUS SYSTEMS 
BASED ON FORCE VOLTAGE ANALOGY:

In electrical systems the elements in series will have same current, likewise in 
mechanical systems, the elements have same velocity are said to be in series.
The elements having same velocity in mechanical system should have analogous same 
current in electrical analogous system.
Each node in the mechanical system corresponds to a closed loop in electrical system.
The number of meshes in electrical analogous is same as that of the number of nodes in 
mechanical system. Hence the number of mesh currents and system equations will be 
same as that of the number of velocities of nodes in mechanical systems.
The mechanical driving force and passive elements connected to the node in mechanical 
system should be represented by analogous elements in a closed loop in analogous 
electrical system.
The elements connected between two nodes in mechanical systems are represented as a 
common element between two meshes in electrical analogous system.
